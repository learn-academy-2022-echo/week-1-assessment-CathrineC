# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a program that can access files and save files. Github is a website where you can send and pull files using the program git.

Researched answer: I found that Git is a version control system that lets user manage projects, source code history. Git makes use of repositories and track each project independently. Github on the other hand is like a cloud where you can store the repositories. The website serves as a host that allows user to access the projects anywhere and lets users share their projects to another user.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The JavaScript operators that will return a Boolean value true or false are loose equality (==), strict equality (===), and greater than (>) and less than (<) symbols.

Researched answer: I found that there are different JavaScript Operators that can return a Boolean value. First is Equality Operators which includes the loose equality using ==, and strict equality using ===. Second is the Relational Operators that uses <, >, <=, >=. Next, is the Logical Operators that uses && which means AND, || which means OR, and !== which means OPPOSITE.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is the address or the position of a value. The value is the data of a variable.

Researched answer: I found that index is the location or address of an element in the array. The are numbered that start from 0 and increases by 1 per position. Value on the other hand is the element in the array.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration means to manipulate the values to get an output.

Researched answer: I found that interation in programming are instructions using code in order to achieve a result. In JavaScript the use of iterators defines a sequence to potentially return a value.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming includes a driver and a navigator. The driver has the access to the code and following the navigators's instructions. The navigator on the other have gives the details to the driver and watches out for possible blocks or errors. Both side should have good listening skills and gives chance to each other to be heard and be a good implementor. 

Researched answer: I found that an effective pair programming session is that they talk about the plan together. They need to change roles so that both will be able to contribute based on their role. This establishes a rhythm. It is important to be able to communicate and collaborate.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A Higher Order Function is a function that accepts function/s as an argument and/or that can return another function. 

2. Jest: Jest is a test runner for JavaScript.

3. Objects: In JavaScript, objects are defined as a standalone entity, with properties and type.

4. Method: In JavaScript, method is an object property that provides a function.

5. Classes: In JavaScript, classes are codes that are encapsulated or grouped to manipulate data.
